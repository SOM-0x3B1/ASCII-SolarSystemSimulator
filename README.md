## About

The purpose of this program is to simulate the physics of a solar system.
It lets the user:
- manage (add, edit delete) celestial bodies in real time
- operate the camera (move, follow)
- speed up simulation
- toggle visual elements
- export and import systems

## Requirements

While the project will probably work on most consoles/terminals, currently it only officially supports the default Command Prompt of Microsoft Windows. Using any other softwares might cause unexpected behavior. <br><br>
In order to keep the program fully functional the following files must be present beside the executable:
- settings.ini
- title.txt
- earth-animation.txt
